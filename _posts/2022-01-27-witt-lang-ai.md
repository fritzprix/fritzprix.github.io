Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capability in tasks that require human-like intelligence. For example, GPT-3 can answer factual questions such as "When did humans first land on the moon?" with great accuracy and can also extract insightful information from a limited amount of data. However, LLMs also have limitations when it comes to tasks that require careful use of knowledge. This is where the analogy to ancient philosophers comes in.

Ancient philosophers, like Plato, made many misleading questions and arguments that have caused confusion in the intellectual history. They were limited by the language and knowledge available to them at the time, just as LLMs are limited by the text data they are trained on. However, this does not take away from the fact that ancient philosophers were great thinkers and made important contributions to the field of philosophy.

Wittgenstein's philosophy on language and the concept of "language games" is particularly relevant in understanding the limitations of LLMs. Wittgenstein argued that the meaning of words and concepts can only be understood within a specific context or "language game." This means that words and concepts can have different meanings depending on the context in which they are used. The same can be said for LLMs, which can generate plausible statements based on the text data they were trained on, but may not have a deep understanding of the concepts they are using.

The evolution of philosophy, from ancient philosophers to modern philosophers like Kant, Karl Popper, and Wittgenstein, can be seen as an analogy to the evolution of LLMs. Just as philosophy has evolved to better understand the limitations and capabilities of human knowledge, LLMs are also evolving to better understand the limitations and capabilities of their knowledge. The development of Reinforcement Learning for Human-in-the-loop Feedback (RLHF) is one example of how LLMs are becoming more capable in knowledge-based tasks. RLHF allows LLMs to learn and adapt to new information in a more human-like way, by incorporating feedback from human users.

Despite their limitations, LLMs hold great promise for the future. They have the ability to analyze vast amounts of data and generate insights that would be impossible for humans to uncover alone. However, it is important to understand their limitations and use them with caution. Playing with language and words is not the same as gaining knowledge. As AI technology advances, the development of multimodal AI, which incorporates sensing capabilities, may help to overcome this limitation by allowing AI to learn and understand the world in a more empirical manner, similar to how human's learn through their five senses. We should be optimistic about the future of LLMs and be prepared to embrace them for their powerful capabilities, while also understanding their limitations and using them responsibly.
