Greetings!

I'm David, an engineer whose passion for technology knows no bounds, covering everything from hardware to software. My curiosity extends into the realms of physics and philosophy, exploring the deep connections between AI and the human mind. I thrive on tackling new challenges, dedicating my free time to personal projects that push my limits.

This blog serves as a chronicle of my journey, capturing the essence of each endeavor and the profound lessons learned. I'm eager to share this space with you, hoping it not only documents my growth but also sparks inspiration and provides insights for other tech enthusiasts, philosophers, and anyone fascinated by the interplay of mind and machine.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something thought-provoking here.
